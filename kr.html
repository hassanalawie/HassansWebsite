                I finally used my HTML, CSS and JS knowledge to create my own
                website. It’s what you’re on right now! As of right now I am
                very happy with how this site came out and I tried to make it as
                responsive as I could. I hope to continue with more websites in
                the future.

                I began to look into python more as I was eager to begin
                applying my programming knowledge. It began with a course on
                Udemy and I am continuing to learn more to this day. I have
                created a couple projects, some of my more notable ones are
                displayed in my website so feel free to look at those.

                During my digital systems course, we needed to learn VHDL to
                apply the concepts we learned in class. The final project was to
                create an ALU using VHDL and to test it on a board. It would
                perform any logic function by use of clocks and various
                flip-flops.

                This year it was required that we learn the C programming
                language as it serves as a good gateway language. The final
                project involved data-analysis using C with a large file of data
                regarding the weather of cities in Ontario.

                Not a very technical achievement but I was elected as the
                president of my high school after 3 years in the student
                council. It was a very rewarding experience as I learned so much
                in terms of project management and leadership as a whole. It was
                definitely a fulfilling end to my high-school career.

                My initial introduction to programming, I learnt the Turing
                programming language. The final project involved here was to
                create a game completely through Turing. This includes all the
                animations involved.
